The goal of this talk is two fold. One is to introduce a framework around Acceptance Test Driven Development that I have been working on for a while called gherkin-salad. The framework is built on using java, cuke4duke & web driver and is being used at McGraw Hill.

Gherkin Salad is an open source framework for automated acceptance test driven development of web applications using java, cuke4duke and web driver. The framework aims to provide the following:
1. A Jump start for users and developers with a bunch of pre defined steps
2. Applying the element object model instead of the page object model
3. Providing a data management module to allow running tests with multiple data sets or in multiple environments
